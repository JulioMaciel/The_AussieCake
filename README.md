This is an application focused on learn some templates to improve your score on IELTS and PTE English Tests.

At the moment, there are four sections: Collocations, Template Essay, Template Describe Image and Template Summarize Written Text.

I started this project on Mid 2018, and released the version 1.0 on March, 2019.

The idead is keeping improving with new features as long as I don't achieve my desired score. After that, the code will be full release to the community who also is studiyng for some of these exams.
